                        <p class="ans">Our Discord server is a very active community of people from all over the world and is moderated by a team of volunteers. Our moderation team has 3 different roles: Core, Maintainer, and Moderator.

                            Our moderation team is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, personal appearance, body, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
                            
                            We expect everyone to handle themselves in a professional manner and follow the spirit of our community rules. The moderation team enforces our rules through a zap system using the Dyno bot. The zaps are private to the user and will be communicated through direct messages or private threads.
                            
                            If you are given a warning by our moderation team, please consider our point of view and be willing to change without taking it personally or being argumentative. Our rules are very similar to the expectations in professional workplaces, so this will better prepare you to interact professionally with your future teammates.
                            
                            Our rules have different levels of severity and zaps are given at the discretion of the moderator team. Repeated offenses automatically increase to the next penalty tier. Zaps accumulate over time if rules continue to be broken to ensure the well-being of our entire community.

                            <strong>Chat bombing</strong><br>

                            <strong>Inappropriate User Profile</strong><br>
                            - Examples: suggestive or inappropriate memes as profile picture, username/nickname, or bio.<br>
                            
                            <strong>Crossposting or Duplicate Posts</strong><br>
                            - Examples: posting the same message to different channels or asking for help in multiple channels at once.
                            - You should allow at least 30 minutes for a reply. While you are waiting, make sure that you posted in the most relevant channel, provided a detailed question, and continue trouble-shooting. It is recommended to edit your post with the results of things you have tried. If your post gets buried, you may repost your question, otherwise, you may direct people to your question in a more active channel.<br>
